# DJS01: Vanilla JS Podcast App

## Overview

I designed and built a responsive web application that allows users to **browse podcast shows** on a landing page and **view detailed information** in a modal. The application displays clear, concise previews of podcast shows and offers additional information through a modal pop-up, **all without navigating away from the page**. 
My app showcases clean code architecture and strong UI/UX design while following JavaScript best practices.
